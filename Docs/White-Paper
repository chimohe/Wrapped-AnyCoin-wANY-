ü™ô AnyCoin White Paper

Overview

AnyCoin is a decentralized framework for wrapping crypto tokens into USD-pegged stable representations, enabling practical and spendable use in real-world scenarios. The system introduces Wrapped AnyCoin (wANY), a token backed by USDC and tied to the USD value of a user-selected input token. Users can interact with the system through a decentralized bridge and debit card integration, turning volatility into stability while maintaining crypto-native control.

‚öôÔ∏è System Components

1. Wrapped AnyCoin (wANY)

wANY is an ERC-20 token that represents the USD-equivalent value of a selected input token (e.g., meme or utility token). wANY is minted when users deposit supported tokens or USDC and burned when users withdraw or spend via a debit card.
	‚Ä¢	Pegged 1:1 to USD (backed by USDC)
	‚Ä¢	Minted via deposits and swaps
	‚Ä¢	Burned via withdrawals or fiat settlements

‚∏ª

2. USDC-to-AnyCoin Bridge

A smart contract system that:
	‚Ä¢	Accepts deposits of USDC or a user-selected token
	‚Ä¢	Swaps between assets using a DEX (e.g., Uniswap)
	‚Ä¢	Mints the appropriate amount of wANY to the user
	‚Ä¢	Handles redemptions by burning wANY and returning USDC or the selected token

‚∏ª

3. Decentralized Exchange Integration

The bridge interacts with popular DEX routers to:
	‚Ä¢	Convert USDC into the selected token
	‚Ä¢	Convert the token back into USDC during withdrawals
	‚Ä¢	Minimize slippage through real-time price routing

‚∏ª

4. Debit Card Integration (via payment partner)
	‚Ä¢	wANY balances can be mapped to a crypto-enabled debit card
	‚Ä¢	When a user makes a purchase, wANY is burned and the equivalent USD is settled to the merchant
	‚Ä¢	Enables crypto-native spending with fiat stability

üîÑ Workflow

Deposit Flow
	1.	User selects a supported token and deposits USDC
	2.	Smart contract swaps USDC for the selected token via a DEX
	3.	USD-equivalent value is calculated
	4.	wANY tokens are minted and sent to the user‚Äôs wallet

Spending Flow
	1.	User links wANY wallet to a debit card
	2.	Purchase triggers wANY burn and fiat settlement to merchant
	3.	Transaction is logged and balance is updated

Withdrawal Flow
	1.	User burns wANY to redeem funds
	2.	Smart contract returns USDC or re-converts to the selected token
	3.	User receives their asset back based on current exchange rates

Tokenomics
	‚Ä¢	Token Name: Wrapped AnyCoin
	‚Ä¢	Symbol: wANY
	‚Ä¢	Peg: 1:1 USD, backed by USDC
	‚Ä¢	Minting/Burning:
	‚Ä¢	wANY is minted when users deposit supported tokens (or USDC) and their value is converted to USD.
	‚Ä¢	wANY is burned when users withdraw funds or make debit card purchases.
	‚Ä¢	Backing Asset: USDC (USD Coin) held in the bridge smart contract
	‚Ä¢	Fees:
	‚Ä¢	A small transaction fee may be applied during minting, burning, or debit card spending to support protocol maintenance and operations.
	‚Ä¢	Supply Model:
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic. wANY is not pre-mined. Supply adjusts based on user activity (minted on deposit, burned on redemption).
